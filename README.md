# 🔍 ShodanTS:

A lightweight and modern [Shodan API](https://www.shodan.io/) client written in TypeScript, powered by the [Deno runtime](https://deno.land/). 

This client is fully built based on the Shodan API documentation: https://developer.shodan.io/api

Please note that this project is independently developed and not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Shodan. 

> At the beginning, I just needed a small client to help me with some personal projects. There was already a small nice client called [shodan_deno](https://github.com/aldinp16/shodan_deno), but it was too limited for my needs. So I decided to create my own from scratch with a completely reinvented structure and share it on my GitHub.

## Note:
Some methods are not currently implemented. These include:

- `Internet scan` via `shodan/scan/internet` (requires an enterprise license)
- `Network Alerts`
- `Notifiers`
- `Bulk Data` (requires an enterprise license)
- `Manage Organization` (requires an enterprise license)
- `Data Streams` (requires an enterprise license)

## 🚀 Getting Started:

### ✅ Requirements:

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) 
- A valid [Shodan API key](https://account.shodan.io/)
- Internet connection

### 📦 Usage:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nde-Code/ShodanTS.git
```

2. **Go in the ShodanTS cloned folder:**

```bash
cd ShodanTS
```

3. **Run the client:**

```bash
deno run --allow-net example.ts
```

#### Or use the code below:

```ts
import { shodanClient } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nde-Code/ShodanTS/v1.1.0/mod.ts";

// Of course, never do this in production (never put your secret key directly in the code)!
// Instead, use environment variables configured via a .env file.
// Take a look at: https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/env_variables/
const client = new shodanClient("API_Key");

// For JSON:
const myProfile = await client.getAccountProfile();

interface myProfileObject {

    member: boolean

    credits: number

    display_name: unknown

    created: string

}

// If you like TypeScript types and want to create your own:
const myProfileAsType = await client.getAccountProfile<myProfileObject>();

console.log("Full JSON:", myProfile);

console.log("Member:", myProfileAsType.member);

console.log("You have used", myProfileAsType.credits, "credits this month.");

console.log("Displayed name:", myProfileAsType.display_name);

console.log("Account created on:", myProfileAsType.created);
````

Run your file with the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-net your_file.ts
```

### Make sure you've set your API key in the code.

> Currently, I haven’t created a package on [JSR](https://jsr.io/) or any other package platforms, but I might do so later.
